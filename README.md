# GridWorld Q-Learning & Naive Bayes Classifier

This project consists of two main parts:

1. **Q-Learning agent for a 4x4 GridWorld**
2. **Naive Bayes classifier (from scratch)**

## Folder Structure

```
gridworld/
    environment.py      # GridWorld environment
    qlearning_agent.py  # Q-Learning algorithm
    run_experiment.py   # Experiment script

naive_bayes/
    naive_bayes.py      # Naive Bayes algorithm
    dataset.py          # Sample dataset
    run_experiment.py   # Experiment script
```

## How to Run

For GridWorld Q-Learning:
```
cd gridworld
python run_experiment.py
```

For Naive Bayes:
```
cd naive_bayes
python run_experiment.py
```

## Notes
- All main algorithms are implemented from scratch, no ready-made libraries are used.
- The code is modular and well-commented.
